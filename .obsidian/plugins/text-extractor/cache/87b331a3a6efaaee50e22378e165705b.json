Beauty in Phonology 昔我往矣， 杨柳依依。 今我来思， 雨雪霏霏。 Willows were green when we set out, it’s blow in a snow as we go down this road, muddy and slow,hungry and thirsty and blue (no one feels half of what we know). -- Ezra Pound When I left here, Willows shed tear. I come back now, Snow bends the bough. Fishing in Snow From hill to hill no bird in flight; From path to path no man in sight. A boat- coat-hat fisherman afloat, Fishing snow in a lonely chilly boat.

My wife’s soft hair must be wet from the scented night-mist, and her white arms chilled by the cold moonlight. When shall we lean on the open casement together and gaze at the moon until the tears on our cheeks dry? ( By David Hawkes) 《月夜》 杜甫 今夜鄜州月，闺中只独看。 遥怜小儿女，未解忆长安。 香雾云鬟湿，清辉玉臂寒。 何时倚虚幌，双照泪痕干。 Nostalgia (静夜思，Li Bai) A splash of white on my bedroom floor. Hoarfrost? I raise my eyes to the moon, the same moon. As scenes long past come to mind, my eyes fall again on the splash of white, and my heart aches for home. (Translated by 翁显良 ) 《楚辞• 天问》 汤谋易旅，何以厚之？ 覆舟斟寻，何道取之？ 桀伐蒙山，何所得焉？ 妺嬉何肆，汤何殛焉？ 舜闵在家，父何以鳏？ 尧不姚告，二女何亲？ 厥萌在初，何所亿焉？ 璜台十成，谁所极焉？ 登立为帝，孰道尚之？ 女娲有体，孰制匠之？ 舜服厥弟，终然为害。 何肆犬豕，而厥身不危败。 4.2 Beauty in Formality （ Form） 哦再见,可爱的林木 哦再见， 可爱的林木， 高高耸立的山峦； 再见吧一切低幽山谷， 凄清山岩，蜿蜒曲折的溪流， 我的温顺羊群和所有亲密朋友！ 再见吧我的芦笛，我的美妙动人的乐曲, 它们曾使舞在田间的绝色女郎欢愉； 不满足呀你的打击最重最致命， 无情地碾碎最最真挚的心； 可我要对别人的得意， 终日伴我的悲叹、 眼泪和愁绪 说再见 FAREWELL, SWEET GROVES Farewell, Sweet groves to you; You hills, that highest dwell, And all you humble vales, adieu. You wanton brooks and solitary rocks, My dear companions all, and you, my tender flocks! Farewell, my pipe, and all those pleasing songs, whose moving strains Delighted once the fairest nymphs that dance upon the plains; You discontents, whose deep and over- deadly smart, Have, without pity, broke the truest heart; Sighs, tears, and every sad annoy, That erst did with me dwell, And all other's joy Farewell!
