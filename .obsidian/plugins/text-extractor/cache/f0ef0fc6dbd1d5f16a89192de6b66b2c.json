During the following 100 years of Renaissance flourish, there appeared many figures of letters, such as Thomas More, Christopher Marlowe, Philip Sydney, William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser and Francis Bacon. English Renaissance is usually divided into three periods. 1) The beginning period from 1485 to 1558. 2) The flowering period from 1558 to 1603, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, then the period is called Elizabethan period. 3) The final period from 1603 to 1660, started after the death of the Queen and ended at the Restoration of Stuart Dynasty. Renaissance writers advocated Humanism in their works.Humanism is the key word of English Renaissance. Humanism advocated the dignity and central position of human beings in the universe and emphasized the importance of studying Greek and Roman classical literature and philosophy. Humanists put more emphasis on the moral and practical functions of the classics rather than its aesthetic values. They insisted on the first importance of reason. Humanists emphasized the capacities of human mind and the achievements of human culture. They stressed the need for a rounded development of an individual’s diverse powers in physical，mental, artistic and moral aspects, as opposed to a merely technical or specialized kind of training. Geoffrey Chaucer (1343-1400), the forerunner of English Renaissance, is regarded as the father of English poetry. He introduced from France the rhymed stanzas into English poetry to replace alliterative verse in Old English. He is considered to be the first realistic writer in English literary history. His works presented us an array of characters from all walks of life and a panoramic view of the English society of his day. He is looked upon as a messenger of humanism in England. In his writings, Chaucer affirmed man’s right to earthly happiness. At the supreme of Renaissance, Shakespeare is the mouth speaker of Humanism. 1.What is the essence of English Renaissance? A.

Text B My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the earth or a tent upon the earth: and, in short, I resolved upon both, the manner and description of which it may not be improper to give an account of. I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near the sea, and, I believed, would not be wholesome, and more particul arly because there was no fresh water near it, so I resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground. I consulted several things in my situation which I found would be proper for me: 1st, health and fresh water I just now mentioned; shelter from the heat of the sun; 3rdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for me deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my expectation yet. In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top; on the side of this rock there was a hollow place worn a little way in like the entrance or door of a cave, but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all. On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad and about twice as long, and lay like a green before my door, and at the end of it descended irregularly every way down into the low-grounds by the seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a w. and by s. sun, or thereabouts, which in those countries is near the setting. Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and ending. In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of the ground about five foot and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another. Then I took the piece of cable which I had cut in the ship, and I laid them in rows one upon another, within the circle, between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the in-side, leaning against them, about two foot and a half high, like a spur to a post, and this fence was so strong that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them into the earth. 第 4 页 （共 4 页） 4.
