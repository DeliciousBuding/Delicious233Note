Renaissance in British literatureFrancis Bacon 弗朗西斯∙培根 “Knowledge is Power” “A wise man is strong, a man of knowledge can increase strength.” “ Knowledge is more than equivalent to force.” Of Study, Of Travel, Of Wisdom Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment, and disposition of business. OF STUDY By Francis Bacon 读书足以怡情，足以傅彩，足以长才。 其怡情也，最见于独处幽居之时； 其傅彩也，最见于高谈阔论之中； 其长才也，最见于处世判事之际。 Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtitle; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend.(Abeunt studia in mores）. 读史使人明智，读诗使人灵秀，数 学使人周密;科学使人深刻， 伦理学使人庄重， 逻辑修辞之学使人善辩； 凡有所学，皆成性格。 1.The superior man extensively learns universal knowledge. 君子博学于文 2.The benevolent is free from anxiety, the learned from puzzlement. 仁者不忧，智者不惑 3.An excellent learner can be a good governor. 学而优则仕 Chinese Wisdom 4.Study extensively, enquire accurately, reflect carefully, discriminate clearly and practice earnestly. ——“The Doctrine of the Mean” 博学之，审问之，慎思之，明辨之，笃行之。——《中庸》 Reading 5 OF STUDY By Francis Bacon STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use for delight, is in privatness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment, and disposition of business. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. Reading makes a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. Therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit: and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know, that he doth not. Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtitle; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend. Abeunt studia in mores. 1.

III. Shakespearean tragedy presents the tragedy of a hero in terms of tragic flaw in the character of the hero. Lear is a man of remarkable qualities, but he lacks ability to distinguish between the right and the wrong, the just and the unjust. Othello is a great and noble man, but he is jealous and impractical and he falls. Macbeth is a brave and noble man, but his vaulting ambition overleaps itself and brings about his fall. Hamlet too meets with a tragic end because of his irresolute nature and inability to accept the role ordained by nature for him. Hamlet is endowed with exceptional qualities like royal birth, graceful and charming personality and popularity among his own countrymen, he has a high intellectual quality, but the flaw in his character named as 'tragic flaw' by A.C. Bradley makes him a tragic hero. Like other tragic heroes Hamlet too has to face conflict, both internal and external. The internal conflict is between his moral scruples and the act of revenge, which he is called upon to perform. Love of his father, the dishonor of his mother, and the villainy of his uncle prompt him to take revenge while his nobility, his moral idealism, his principles and his religion revolt against such a brutal act, so that he suffers mental torture. The external conflict is with Claudius--- the murderer of his father. To Hamlet, Claudius is a smiling, damned villain, a seducer and a usurper of his rights to Denmark's throne. The other external conflicts are with Laertes, his friend and the brother of his beloved Ophelia, with Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, his former school fellows and friends but present enemies. Character is not the only factor that is responsible for the tragedy of Hamlet. External circumstances are also responsible for making him tragic hero. The appearance of the Ghost and its revelation is a manifestation of Fate. Many things that take place in his life are by chance. He kills Polonius by chance. The ship in which he travels is attacked by pirates, and his return to Denmark is nothing but chance. Gertrude drinks the poisoned wine, by accident, and dies. So fate in the shape of chance shapes the future of all characters. But the sense of fate is never so overwhelming as to cast character in shade; after all, it is Hamlet himself who is responsible for his tragedy. 3.1 What are Hamlet’s internal and external conflicts according to the text? 3.2 “Hamlet’s tragedy is not only a personal tragedy, but a tragedy of humanists” How do you understand the statement?","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
